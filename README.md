# loop
# Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.


##  for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
  
 ##   while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
